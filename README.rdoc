== README

This is a rough draft of a survey monkey clone done as a shadowing experience. 

Tech stack used includes Ruby, Ruby on Rails, javascript, Firebase, and Angular JS. Kendo JS was starting to be included but I ran out of time.

As this was a quick project meant to be about learning new technology the code is somewhat messy and could certainly use some refactoring.
